This project is a simple giph generator app that calls on an api from Giphy and generates random giphs based on the input the user types in the search
bar. It is intended for web users or social media users, even developers who want a simple way to grab gifs so they can be more expressive online or
make their website more animated.

The site uses a nav bar that take you directly to each section when clicked. There's a back to top button to reduce scrolling. The search engine is simple to use, just type in any keyword or phrase relating to anything you'd like and hit submit. This will cause the site to generate gifs related to the user's search query.

Technologies used are an html page, css, and javascript. A combination of Bootsrap and Tailwind are used to make the site responsive. Jquery is used to call the API from Giphy to retrieve the giphs. 

Ideas for future improvement:
1. Add an animated logo just to make the site's appearance more interesting. (I'd like to make the gears in the logo turn continuosly)
2. Add a counter to say how many giphs were generated based on the user's query and let them know how many results were found.
3. Add a pop up or response that says "no results found" if there's no results.
